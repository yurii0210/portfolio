Це стандартний файл README.md, який генерується Create React App. Оскільки він вже написаний англійською мовою, я додав до нього структурування та короткі пояснення до кожного розділу, щоб він виглядав професійніше у вашому репозиторії.

🚀 Portfolio Project Documentation
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. It serves as a modern, responsive web application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI.

🛠 Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
Purpose: Runs the app in development mode.

Access: Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Features: The page will automatically reload when you save changes. Lint errors are displayed in the console.

npm test
Purpose: Launches the interactive test runner.

Mode: Watch mode by default.

npm run build
Purpose: Compiles the application for production to the build folder.

Optimization: Minifies the code, optimizes assets, and includes hashes in filenames for caching.

Result: Your app is ready for deployment (e.g., to Vercel, Netlify, or a VPS).

npm run eject
⚠️ Warning: This is a one-way operation.

Purpose: If you need full control over Webpack/Babel configurations, this command moves all dependencies and config files into your project.

Recommendation: Avoid using this unless you have a specific architectural requirement that Create React App doesn't support.

🏗 Key Features & Architecture
State Management: Handled by Redux Toolkit (Slices for projects, skills, and contact form).

Routing: React Router v6 for seamless page transitions.

UI Framework: Material UI (MUI) with a customized dark theme.

Animations: Framer Motion for smooth scroll and hover effects.

Styling: A mix of MUI System and global CSS3 animations.
